## The `eqn-desc` branch

Independently from the master branch, this branch sets up **transient**
simulations for the "OpenFOAM Workflow: Equation Discretisation"
module.

#### Pure Advection

The diffusion coefficient is set to 0, and we simulate 1.5 seconds of purely advective
flow (U = `(1 0 0)` ) on a 100-cells 1D mesh.
